You are going to develop 'your own' algorithm to compute the best path using any data structure of your choice.  Challenge yourself to think about how your code will determine the shortest path from Bob to another friend.  Each path will always start with Bob and will include the shortest paths for the following friend paths:

Bob -> Sam

Bob -> Paula {Should report equal paths found and use one of the paths}

Bob -> Barb

Bob -> Titus

Bob -> Vita

Bob -> Tom {Should print Friend not found! Starts with Bob}

Do some research about shortest path algorithms but use one of our own design.  How can you store the paths, what kind of weights can  you assign or rules that help you determine which path is the shortest.  You will present your idea in class.

Make your code as dynamic as possible, that is, use variables instead of hard coding friends and other dynamic material. 

Submit the following:  Commented code, zipped project folder, screen shots of code & console execution output.

Here is my sample run:

~ Best friend path from Bob to Sam is: ~
Bob --> Castor --> Marco --> Atia --> Sam

::Path 1 and Path 2 are equal!::
~ Best friend path from Bob to Paula is: ~
Bob --> Alice --> Peter --> Falco --> Barb --> Vita --> Paula

~ Best friend path from Bob to Barb is: ~
Bob --> Alice --> Peter --> Falco --> Barb

~ Best friend path from Bob to Titus is: ~
Bob --> Castor --> Marco --> Atia --> Sam --> Titus

~ Best friend path from Bob to Vita is: ~
Bob --> Alice --> Peter --> Falco --> Barb --> Vita

~ Friend Tom not found!  Start with Bob ~
